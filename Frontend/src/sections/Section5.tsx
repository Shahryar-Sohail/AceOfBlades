                        Damascus is a well-known style of steel that is distinguishable by its contrasting marble light and dark design.  There are two types of Damascus steel (cast Damascus steel and pattern-welded Damascus steel).  Although similar looking, they are forged through very specific and different processes. Historically, Damascus steel was always prized for its beauty, as well as ability to keep a sharp edge while remaining strong and flexible. Seen as the “Steel of Ancients”, arms made of Damascus steel are superior to those made of iron. Damascus craftsmanship gained a reputation of near magical properties and with only a precious few that knew how to achieve this, it would become a precious piece of history for any arms enthusiast.</p>
